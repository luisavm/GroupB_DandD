# Drag & Drop Puzzle Game 

This puzzle game is based on unscramble the pieces to make a picture, there are four different pictures.

We learned to build the Puzzle Drag and Drop in class. We would need to figure out where to solve two problems that would research:

 1. The first bug only needs one piece in one drop zone when a user drags and drops for once at a time because they still have more puzzle pieces than one puzzle piece. 

 2. The second bug needs to be removed pieces that show up on the drop zones. As when the user wants to click thumb to change pieces, the pieces still stay the same drop zones, which should be removed. 

The projectâ€™s goal is to improve the puzzle game UX for users.

There are four different thumb pieces, you would choose first one. When you click one thumb piece and then click on the puzzle piece on the left hand side that you want to move to right board. Hold your mouse down to the right board (drop zones)and move the puzzle piece to where you think it should go and continue doing that until complete four pieces.
